		┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
		│ Software Developer Intern @ University of Illinois – Urbana Champaign │
		└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
		• Created train, and fine-tuned transformer-based language model and OpenAI GPT-3 to write and grade papers
		according to a given rubric. Our model graded unseen papers with a 93% accuracy.
		• Pre-processed and standardized training data from various essay sources to enhance model performance.
		• Developed an interactive frontend interface using React to visualize the results of the assessment and
		generationmodels.

		┌────────────────────────────────────┐
		│ Software Developer @ Ernst & Young │
		└────────────────────────────────────┘
		• Commissioned by Ernst & Young, to research and develop novel stock options pricing methods using Quantum
		Computing.
		• Implemented state of the art options pricing models such as Black Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations for
		quantum
		computing using Qiskit. Researched the effectiveness of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) for
		options
		pricing accuracy and developed a Quantum Finance API for future development.
		• Packaged our models into an API for future development.

		┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
		│ Software Engineering % Machine Learning Intern @ NE Quest │
		└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
		• Programmed a Machine Learning pipeline using TensorFlow and OpenCV to calculate the likelihood of diseases in observed
		patients. Cleaned and normalized data collected through experimental testing on patients to be used for creating
		the model.
		• Digitized an algorithm in Python for the neurological Clock and Spiral test used by doctors to detect dementia
		in patients. My algorithm is currently deployed on the NE Quest app on the app store.
		• Designed and programmed a front-end using React for intuitive interaction with the neurological test.
